Lip Sync Model Implementation Assignment
This project implements a lip sync model for generating realistic lip-synced videos as part of an internship assignment. The implementation is based on the open-source Wav2Lip repository, which was used to create the final results.

Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the Pre-trained Model:

Visit the Wav2Lip repository and follow the instructions to download the pre-trained model checkpoint.
Place the checkpoint file in an appropriate directory (or specify its path when running the inference).
Usage
To generate a lip-synced video, run the following command from the project root:

bash
Copy
Edit
python inference.py --checkpoint_path <path-to-checkpoint> --face input/anika_speech.mp4 --audio input/input_audio.mp3
Replace <path-to-checkpoint> with the actual path to your downloaded model checkpoint. The output video(s) will be saved in the output/ folder.

Additional Information
Text-to-Speech:
The audio for this project was generated using the PlayHT website with an Indian accent.

Wav2Lip:
This project builds upon the open-source Wav2Lip repository. For detailed instructions on the model and additional features, please refer to their documentation.

Acknowledgments
Many thanks to the creators of Wav2Lip for their excellent open-source contribution.
Thanks to PlayHT for providing a robust text-to-speech service.
